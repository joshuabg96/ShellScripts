Operaciones aritméticas
+ = suma
- = resta
* = multiplicación
/ = División
% = residuo

Para que se ejecute la operación tendremos que ponerla sin espacios dentro de $(())

Conditional Operations
- Its objetive is to check if an expression is true or false
- We use test command and we can use it in two ways
    - test expression or [expression]
        - Example:
            - test 10 -gt 20
            - [10 -gt 20]
            - test 'hola' = 'holita'
            - ['hola' = 'holita']
- Options for numbers
    - -eq: Equal
    - -ge: Greater or equal than
    - -gt: Greater than
    - -le: Less than or equal to
    - -lt: Less than
    - -ne: different

-If Conditional
    - Execute one or more instrucctions of the condition is meet
    - Sintaxis
        - if CONDITION; then
            commands
          fi
    - Example:
        if [$v1 -gt $v2]; then
            echo "The variable v1 is greater than v2"
        fi

Text Comparisson
- =: Is equal
- >: Is greater than
- <: Is less than
- !=: is not equal
- -n: The lenght is different than cero

Other Expressions:
- !: True if the Expression is false
- Expression1 -a Expression2: True if both expressions are true (and)
- Expression1 -o Expression2: Tur if any expression is true (or)

Files and directories
-d Path: if the Path exist and it is a directory
-e Path: If the path exist no matter what element is
-f Path: If the path exist and it standar File
-r Path: If the path exist and it can be read
-w Path: If the path exist and it can be written
-x Path: If the path exist and it is executable
-s Path: If the path exist and its size is greater than zero

Regular Expression Comparisson
- [[string =~ regex]]
- Example:
    [[ $ANSWER =~ ^(s|S|si|SI|sí|SÍ)$ ]]


Operations with a text variable 
${#var}: Return the lenght of the string
${var:position}: Return the string from the position to the end
${ver:position:lenght}: Retunr from the position with the selected lenght
${var#patron}: Delete from the start the shorter part that match with the patron
${var##patron}: Delete from the start the largest part that match with the patron
${var%patron}: Delete from the end the shorter part that match with the patron
${var/patron/string}: Replace first match of the patron with string
${var//patron/string}: Replace all the patrons with string
